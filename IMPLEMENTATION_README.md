# Google Authentication Implementation

This implementation provides the first user story: **Google Sign-In authentication** for the Baby Routine Tracker Android app.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ User Story Acceptance Criteria Met

1. **"Sign in with Google" button is clearly visible** - The sign-in screen displays a prominent Google Sign-In button
2. **Standard Android Google account selection** - Uses the official Google Sign-In API which shows the account picker
3. **Successful authentication and navigation** - After signing in, users are automatically navigated to the main dashboard
4. **Automatic sign-in persistence** - Users remain logged in on subsequent app launches

### ✅ Technical Implementation

1. **Firebase Authentication SDK** - Integrated and configured for Google Sign-In
2. **Google Sign-In UI flow** - Implemented using Jetpack Compose with proper activity result handling
3. **User session persistence** - Firebase Auth automatically maintains user sessions
4. **Modern UI/UX** - Clean, Material Design 3 interface with light/dark theme support

## Key Components

### AuthService
Handles all Firebase and Google Sign-In operations:
- Google Sign-In client configuration
- Firebase authentication with Google credentials
- User session management
- Sign out functionality

### AuthViewModel
Manages authentication state using Jetpack Compose state management:
- Loading states during sign-in process
- User authentication state
- Error handling and display
- Automatic session persistence

### Sign-In Flow
1. User opens app → checks if already authenticated
2. If not authenticated → shows sign-in screen
3. User taps "Sign in with Google" → launches Google account picker
4. User selects account → authenticates with Firebase
5. Success → navigates to dashboard with user info

## Firebase Configuration

The app includes a `google-services.json` file with placeholder values. For production use, you'll need to:

1. Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Add your Android app with package name `com.github.slamdev.babyroutinetracker`
3. Enable Authentication → Sign-in method → Google
4. Download the real `google-services.json` file
5. Replace the placeholder file with your real configuration

## Next Steps

With authentication complete, the app is ready for the next user stories:
- Activity logging (sleep, feeding, diapers)
- Real-time dashboard with live data
- Data visualization
- AI-powered sleep routine suggestions

## Testing

To test the Google Sign-In functionality:
1. Ensure you have Google Play Services installed
2. Use a real Android device or emulator with Google Play
3. The app will prompt for Google account selection
4. After sign-in, you'll see the dashboard with user information

## Dependencies Added

- Firebase BOM and Authentication
- Google Play Services Auth
