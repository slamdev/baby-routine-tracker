  * Use Firestore's real-time listeners (onSnapshot) to keep all connected clients synchronized.

### **Activity Logging**

**User Story:** As a tired parent, I want to log my baby's sleep with just a start and stop button so that I can quickly record sleep sessions, even in the middle of the night.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  * The main dashboard displays a "Start Sleep" button.  
  * Tapping "Start Sleep" changes its state to an active "Stop Sleep" button and starts a visible timer.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  * The feeding card displays both "Breast Milk" and "Bottle" options directly on the main screen.  
  * For breast milk: tapping "Start Feeding" begins a real-time timer, tapping "Stop Feeding" ends the session and logs the duration automatically.
