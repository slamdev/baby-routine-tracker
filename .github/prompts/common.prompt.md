follow the below docs during all the tasks, make updates in the docs when I ask to change requirements:
- plan is defined in [project-plan](../../project-plan.md) file
- hight level stories are defined in [hight-level-stories](../../hight-level-stories.md) file
- low level tasks are defined in [technical-tasks](../../technical-tasks.md) file
- implementation guide is in [implementation-guide](../../implementation-guide.md) file

Use firebase mcp server if you need to work with firebase database or functions. 

Use context7 mcp server if you need to work with any library or cli tool.
