# Production Security Checklist

## Overview
This checklist ensures the Baby Routine Tracker app meets security standards for production release.

## ‚úÖ Firebase Security Configuration

### Firestore Security Rules
- [x] **Rules are restrictive by default**: Only authenticated users can access data
- [x] **User isolation**: Users can only access babies where their userId is in parentIds array
- [x] **Activity logs protection**: Only parents can read/write baby activities
- [x] **Invitation system security**: Proper invitation code validation and user verification
- [x] **Cloud Functions access**: Custom authentication allows Cloud Functions to access data for notifications
- [x] **Notification preferences**: Users can only write their own preferences but can read partner preferences for shared babies

### Firebase Authentication
- [x] **Google Sign-in configured**: Using secure Google authentication
- [x] **No anonymous authentication**: All features require authenticated users
- [x] **JWT token validation**: Proper token verification in security rules

### Cloud Functions Security
- [x] **Node.js 18**: Using current LTS version
- [x] **Firebase Admin SDK**: Latest version with security updates
- [x] **Custom authentication**: Proper service account configuration for Firestore access

## ‚úÖ Android App Security

### Build Configuration
- [x] **Release signing**: Proper keystore configuration for production builds
- [x] **ProGuard/R8 enabled**: Code obfuscation and optimization enabled
- [x] **Debug disabled**: No debug flags in release builds
- [x] **Application ID**: Unique application identifier configured

### API Key Security
- [x] **Google Services JSON**: Properly configured with production Firebase project
- [x] **API restrictions**: Firebase API keys restricted to specific applications
- [x] **No hardcoded secrets**: No sensitive data in source code

### Network Security
- [x] **HTTPS only**: All Firebase communication uses HTTPS
- [x] **Certificate pinning**: Firebase SDK handles certificate validation
- [x] **Network security config**: Default Android security policies applied

## üîç Additional Security Measures

### Data Protection
- [x] **GDPR compliance**: Account deletion functionality implemented
- [x] **Data encryption**: Firebase provides encryption in transit and at rest
- [x] **Minimal permissions**: App requests only necessary permissions
- [x] **Local data storage**: No sensitive data stored locally

### Input Validation
- [x] **Client-side validation**: Proper input validation in UI components
- [x] **Server-side validation**: Firebase security rules validate data structure
- [x] **SQL injection prevention**: Using Firestore (NoSQL) with parameterized queries
- [x] **XSS prevention**: No web views with untrusted content

## üîß Production Configuration Checklist

### Firebase Console Settings
- [ ] **Production project**: Ensure using production Firebase project (not development)
- [ ] **API key restrictions**: Verify API keys are restricted to production app signature
- [ ] **Authentication providers**: Only necessary providers enabled (Google)
- [ ] **Database location**: Appropriate region selected for performance and compliance
- [ ] **Backup enabled**: Firestore backup configured
- [ ] **Monitoring enabled**: Performance monitoring and error reporting configured

### Google Play Console (When Ready)
- [ ] **App signing**: Use Google Play App Signing for additional security
- [ ] **Target API level**: Meeting current Google Play requirements
- [ ] **Permissions review**: Verify requested permissions are necessary and justified
- [ ] **Content rating**: Appropriate content rating applied
- [ ] **Security review**: Pass Google Play security scans

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation Notes
1. **Offline functionality removed**: App requires internet connection, reducing offline attack vectors
2. **Real-time synchronization**: All data changes immediately synced and validated
3. **Multi-user access**: Proper parent verification before data access
4. **Invitation system**: Time-limited invitation codes with proper validation

### Future Security Enhancements
- [ ] **Rate limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for API calls
- [ ] **Advanced threat protection**: Monitor for suspicious activity patterns
- [ ] **Regular security audits**: Schedule periodic security reviews
- [ ] **Penetration testing**: Consider third-party security assessment

## üö® Incident Response Plan

### Security Incident Procedures
1. **Immediate response**: Disable affected functionality if possible
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact of security issue
3. **Communication**: Notify users if data may be compromised
4. **Remediation**: Deploy fixes through app updates
5. **Documentation**: Document incident and prevention measures

### Emergency Contacts
- **Firebase Support**: Through Firebase console support
- **Google Play Support**: Through Play Console support
- **Development Team**: Internal escalation procedures

## üìã Regular Security Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Review Firebase usage patterns for anomalies
- [ ] Check for dependency security updates
- [ ] Monitor error logs for security-related issues
- [ ] Verify backup integrity

### Quarterly Tasks
- [ ] Review and update security rules if needed
- [ ] Audit user permissions and access patterns
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Review third-party library security advisories

### Annual Tasks
- [ ] Comprehensive security audit
- [ ] Update emergency response procedures
- [ ] Review compliance requirements
- [ ] Security training for development team

## üìù Compliance Notes

### GDPR Compliance
- [x] **Right to erasure**: Account deletion removes all user data
- [x] **Data transparency**: Privacy policy explains data collection and usage
- [x] **Consent**: Users provide consent through app usage and account creation
- [x] **Data minimization**: Only necessary data collected and stored

### Children's Privacy
- [x] **Age-appropriate**: App designed for parental use (not direct child interaction)
- [x] **Parental consent**: Parents control all data entry and sharing
- [x] **No child data collection**: App collects baby care data, not personal child information

This checklist should be reviewed and updated regularly as security requirements and threats evolve.
